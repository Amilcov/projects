The game was inspired from New York Time popular game: Wordle.



**Into**:

    Discover the game on yt channel on React Interview: they used API https://api.frontendexpert.io/api/fe/wordle-words so from the first      seconds I ve paused the vidio and start doing my Wordle ()before even know about the API from algo expert so i google and  found  and      use the API:
    https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=5  

**Implementation**:

1.0 Data in and API used:
  

  for checking i've serach and found an API to check if an word is valid: https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/thesp
  but since that PI dosen t work each time I searchj other API and since all requiered API s Key i found that i can download a json with     all the words (not just 5 length) and used that json to serach the  user gussed word to see if that user exists.
